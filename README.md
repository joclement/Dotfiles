# My Dotfiles

I maintain this repo as my personal dotfiles. I just started to use this repo for my dotfiles. So this project is just in its early stages.

If you would like to this repo, feel free to fork and modify it for your personal preferences.
If you see any improvements, feel free to give open a new issue or send me a mail.
